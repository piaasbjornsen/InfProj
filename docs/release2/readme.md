### Release 2
 
This is the documentation for the second iteration of the group project in the IT1901 course by group 65. The iteration is delivered 19.10.2021 at 8 pm. 

## Description of how we have worked

For this iteration we have used issues and branches for all tasks. All issues and merges are described in gitlab with a summary of the changes made and the reason behind, so that the rest of the group can be updated on each members work. Some issues have been done by group members alone, and bigger issues have been done together in group or pair programming. We have also started adding other members as assigne and reviewer for the merge requests so that the changes made are reviewed and accepted by another member in the group before the changes are merged to master. 

## Code quality

In this sprint we have had a lot more focus on code quality than in earlier steps of the project. We have made some changes in how the project is organized and removed some methods and classes that were superficial. We have tried to make the project less complicated and easier to understand by reducing methods and classes to only have the functionality we need for current iteration. We have also added comments describing each method and attribute in all classes.

We have added tests for all classes and used the test results to fix bugs we had overlooked earlier. We have also added checkstyle, jacoco and spotbugs as done in todolist-example. We have used the tools for code quality testing and made changes accordingly. The test coverage is acceptable for this iteration.
