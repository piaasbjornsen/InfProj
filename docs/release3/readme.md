### Release 3

This is the documentation for the third and final iteration of the group project in the IT1901 course by group 65. The iteration is delivered 28.11.2021

## Description of how we have worked

For this iteration we have continued using issues and branches for all tasks. All issues and merges are described in gitlab with a summary of the changes made and the reason behind, so that the rest of the group can be updated on each members work. Most issues have been done together in group or pair programming for this iteration, as there where bigger tasks and less knowlegde in the group about the tasks. The restapi-service was new to all of us, so we have used the todolist project as inspiration and also copied most of the structure from this project as we didn't have the knowlegde and independence needed to make it work only by own work. It has been challenging to get it right, so there are absolutely improvements we could have made with more experience.

## Code quality

We have gone through the code several times together and tried to make the structure better and more clean. We have tried making tests for the new rest service, but these do not cover everything as we have not been able to make everything work as wanted. We have tried being consistent when handling exceptions so that these are handled correctly and catched in the best places.

We have added tests for most classes and used the test results to fix bugs we had overlooked earlier. We have not added tests for some RemoteApp features due to lack of knowlegde and problems when trying to use server for testing, but this is something that should have been done for a better final product. We have also had issues with the checkstyle, as we have not been able to apply the checkstyle indentation preference in format tool. The checkstyle unfortunately gives unwanted warnings for this problem in all classes...

## Project description

There is a description of the application and the structure of it in readme document in SportsTable folder. There is also a description of how to run the program with RemoteApp and LocalApp.
